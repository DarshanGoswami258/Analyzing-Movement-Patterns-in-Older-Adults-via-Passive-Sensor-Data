This project focused on predicting the movements and daily activities of senior citizens using sensor data to enable real-time activity monitoring. 

The data was initially distributed across four separate datasets categorized by rooms, groups, and other contextual attributes, 

which were merged and cleaned to create a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.

The end-to-end workflow involved data integration, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, predictive modeling, and deployment. Machine learning models were trained to identify and 

predict activity patterns with high accuracy. Finally, the solution was deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and actionable insights.
